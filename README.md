# Typing Challenge Game

This project is a Typing Challenge Game built with Angular. The game presents a random sentence to the user, and the user must type the sentence correctly. The app provides real-time feedback on the correctness of the typed characters.

## Overview

The Typing Challenge Game is designed to help users improve their typing skills. It displays a random sentence, and as the user types, each character is compared to the corresponding character in the sentence. Correct characters are highlighted in green, incorrect characters in red, and pending characters in gray.

## Features

- Displays a random sentence for the user to type.
- Real-time feedback on typing accuracy.
- Highlights correct, incorrect, and pending characters.
- Success message when the sentence is typed correctly.
